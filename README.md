# A Simple Calculator

This code implements a simple calculator program in C++ that performs seven different mathematical operations: sine, square, tangent, cosine, natural logarithm, logarithm with base 10, and power. Each function takes floating-point values as parameters.

## Features
1. Sine (sin)
2. Square (square)
3. Tangent (tan)
4. Cosine (cos)
5. Natural Logarithm (log)
6. Logarithm with base 10 (baseLog)
7. Power (power)

## How it Works
The program is menu-driven and uses a switch-case statement to execute the chosen operation. The user selects an operation by inputting a corresponding number, and the program performs the selected mathematical operation.

## Functions
1. **Power(float x, float y):** Calculates `x` raised to the power `y`.
2. **Sine(float x):** Calculates the sine of `x`.
3. **Square(float x):** Calculates the square root of `x`.
4. **Cos(float x):** Calculates the cosine of `x`.
5. **Tan(float x):** Calculates the tangent of `x`.
6. **Log(float x):** Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of `x`.
7. **Baselog(float x):** Calculates the logarithm of `x` with base 10.
